# mp3zee
A python2 script utilizing youtube-dl to batch download videos from Youtube and other streaming sites, and automatically convert them to mp3 and package them.

1. git clone https://github.com/Synystr/mp3zee
2. cd mp3zee
3. python2 mp3zee.py

NOTE: The first time you run the script, you will want to run the initial update/install operation. It will not work until you do this. If the script starts throwing errors when trying to download, run the initial update again, as youtube-dl will most likely have an updated version.

A better-streamlined version of this update process is planned for a future version.
